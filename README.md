# bikesharing

## Overview
My fictional friend Kate has a potential "angel investor" who is interested in starting a bike-sharing company in Des Moines, IA.  The purpose of this analysis was to analyze NYC Citibike data to determine if a similar bike-sharing business could be successful in Des Moines.  For this project we used Tableau to visualize the data from our analysis to create powerful analytic dashboards that tell a clear story and can easily be shared with others.
## Results
Analysing the NYC Citibike data and creating visualizations using Tableau will hopefully compell our "angel investor" to suppor the Des Moines bikesharing business.  A recap of the most notable points of the analysis are reviewed below with accompanying chart.
In the chart below we can see that most of the trip durations are under 20 minutes with a minimal number of users registering trip durations over 60 minutes.

From the chart below we can see that NYC Citibike useres are overwhelmingly male and the most common trip duration was 5 minutes.

Weekday NYC Citibike usage is highest at the 8 am hour and the 5 and 6 pm hours.  I believe that the reason we see a high concentration of users during these times is because a lot of users are likely using Citibikes to commute to and from work.

In the chart below we can see that the highest usage times are consistent between males and females which suggests that a lot of Citibike users utilize Citibikes to commute to and from work.

By examining the map below, we can see that there is a high density of Citibikes being utilized in the area indicated on the map; this could be an area that has a lot of tourists who are using Citibikes to explore the surrounding areas.

In this graph we see that the highest Citibike usage is between 5-7 pm.
Comparitively speaking, the times that people get off work is likely to have greater variance than the times that people start work; this I believe is why we see the increased pm usage stretched out over a two hour span when many people are using Citibikes to commute home from work.  There may be a lot of people who take the bus to work because they start work at the the same time everyday but then take Citibike to commute home because it is more flexible to their schedule than waiting for a bus.

## Summary

Analysing the NYC Citibike data has provided a great deal of insight that can be used to determine if creating a similar bikesharing business in Des Moines, IA would be a sound investment.  Using Tableau to visualize the data really allows the data to tell a story and from that story, I believe these are the key takeaways:
- Most of the Citibike users are male
- The peak usage times suggest that most Citibike users are using Citibikes to commute to and, even moreso, from work
- Most citibike rentals are in a concentrated area and most trip durations are under 20 minutes

When we analyze the viability of a similar bikesharing company in Des Moines there are some things that should be considered:
- Is the population proportion of males and females in Des Moines, IA similar to NYC?  This is important to know because so many NYC Citibike users are male.
- Do Des Moines and NYC have similar climates?  This is important to know because people are more likely to ride bikes when the weather conditions are favorable.
- What is the average distance that people in Des Moines commute to work?  This is important to know because most NYC citibike usage is less than 20 minutes so people would need to be able to reach their destination in a reasonable amount of time in order for them to consider using a bikesharing service as an option to commute to and/or from work.
